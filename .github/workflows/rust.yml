Wise Melon (wise-melon-deactivatedaccount) wrote on 2016-12-23: GParted fails to run as root under Wayland 	#0 
I have found that after switching from Xorg to Wayland on Ubuntu GNOME 16.10 with GNOME 3.22 that GParted does not run when I try to run it as root. That is when I click the icon and enter my password nothing happens. I have found that when running what is run when the icon is clicked that the output in Terminal is (gparted-pkexec):      Created symlink /run/systemd/system/-.mount → /dev/null.     Created symlink /run/systemd/system/boot-efi.mount → /dev/null.     Created symlink /run/systemd/system/boot.mount → /dev/null.     Created symlink /run/systemd/system/run-user-1000.mount → /dev/null.     Created symlink /run/systemd/system/run-user-120.mount → /dev/null.     Created symlink /run/systemd/system/tmp.mount → /dev/null.     No protocol specified      (gpartedbin:16832): Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display: :0     Removed /run/systemd/system/-.mount.     Removed /run/systemd/system/boot-efi.mount.     Removed /run/systemd/system/boot.mount.     Removed /run/systemd/system/run-user-1000.mount.     Removed /run/systemd/system/run-user-120.mount.     Removed /run/systemd/system/tmp.mount. 
So I am now unable to launch and use GParted as root which is really the only way I can run it in order to make changes.

uses-sdkInstall Windows PE to a DVD, a CD, or an ISO file      Click Start, and type deployment. Right-click Deployment and Imaging Tools Environment and then select Run as administrator.      Create a working copy of the Windows PE files. Specify either x86 or amd64: 
copype amd64 C:\WinPE_amd64 
Create an ISO file containing the Windows PE files:      MakeWinPEMedia /ISO C:\WinPE_amd64 C:\WinPE_amd64\WinPE_amd64.iso      To burn a DVD or CD: In Windows Explorer, right-click the ISO file, and select Burn disc image > Burn, and follow the prompts. 
Using Hyper-V 
When running Windows PE in Hyper-V, consider using an ISO file format instead of a VHD, to enable quick setup of the virtual PC. For more information, see the previous section.
To install Windows PE to a VHD      Create a virtual hard drive (.vhd or .vhdx): 
diskpart
create vdisk file="C:\WinPE.vhdx" maximum=1000
attach vdisk
create partition primary
assign letter=V
format fs=ntfs quick
exit 
Prepare the drive by using MakeWinPEMedia: 
MakeWinPEMedia /UFD C:\WinPE_amd64 V: 
Detach the drive:      diskpart     select vdisk file="C:\WinPE.vhdx"     detach vdisk     exit
